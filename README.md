# SimNetMon
Small and simple Netowrk monitoring written in Python3 that you can control via a Discord Bot remotely.

## Simple Script to monitor your network

That's a really simple tool to monitor your network, it works by performing a **nmap** scan using an external script, that being said 
you obviously must have the nmap framework installed to run this on your machine. Considering the fact that this is written in python3 you can run this in all three main OS's out there (Linux,Windows,MacOS) as long as you follow the installation guide for each one correctly.
